 an individual needs to manage both the heads (information) and hearts (motivation) of others in their organization. Inclusiveness means allowing others to participate in defining problems and selecting solutions. Making decisions without consulting others yields poor management of information, which yields poor quality decisions. Not involving others in decision making also misses opportunities to create ownership of the problem and the decision to address that problem, and to make the decision look more like a solution (than a problem) to others, which means more enthusiasm and commitment at implementation. So inclusiveness means better decisions and more enthusiasm/commitment at implementation, which means more successful leadership.
